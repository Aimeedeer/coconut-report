title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m Aimee Zhu.
I made [Rust in Blockchain][rib] and 
am currently learning Rust programming.

I do consulting on building developer communities.
Here is [my resume](/resume),
and here is a [showcase](/showcase) of some of my work.

### Current Hacks

I am implementing a blockchain in Rust,
and I [blog](/posts) about it slowly.

[The Big Announcement](https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement)
is a tiny Ethereum dapp that I created during [HackFS][hackfs].
I plan to implement it on other blockchains
to gain experience building dapps and tooling.

[Rust in Blockchain][rib] is
a resource center for #Rust and #blockchain developers,
with [RiB Newsletters][rib-news] that publishes each month.
RiB has a growing number of contributors since its first issue in June 2019.

[Coconut Reports](../../reports) is where
I record status updates.
I also write [essays in Chinese](https://newhacker.org) randomly.

[rib-news]: https://rustinblockchain.org/newsletters/

### Favorite Stuff

I use terminal Emacs for almost everything on my laptop,
including programming and writing. 
The Org-mode is powerful.

I love hand drip Kenya coffee and always try to find new, fresh
roasted coffee beans wherever I travel and stay.
Belgian beer and single malt Scotch are my favorite alcohol.

[Cocoverse](https://cocoverse.com) is the adventure space
where my partner and I record our shared experiences.
We experiment with silly ideas there too.
