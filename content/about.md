---

Iâ€™m Aimee Zhu.
I write Rust programs and run [Rust in Blockchain (rib.rs)][rib].

Sometimes I do consulting on building developer communities.
Here is [my resume](/resume),
and here is a [showcase](/showcase) of some of my work.

### Recent Hacks

[Rust in Blockchain][rib]
is a resource center for Rust and blockchain developers,
with [RiB Newsletters][rib-news] that publishes each month.
RiB has a growing number of contributors since its first issue in June 2019.

[Treasure Tree][tt]
is a real-world treasure hunt game where the treasures are represented
as QR codes in the physical world, and NFTs in the virtual.

### Favorite Stuff

I use terminal Emacs for almost everything on my laptop,
including programming and writing. 
The Org-mode is powerful.

I love hand drip Kenya coffee and always try to find new, fresh
roasted coffee beans wherever I travel and stay.
Belgian beer and single malt Scotch used to be my favorite alcohol
and I am into pilsner lately.

[Cocoverse](https://cocoverse.com) is the adventure space
where my partner and I record our shared experiences.
We experiment with silly ideas there too.
