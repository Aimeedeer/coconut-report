`Minnesota, US`

It started snowing this month in Rochester, Minnesota,
and it snows a lot, about every second day
last week. I have seen the most snows in 2020 compared to previous years.

The most satisfying moment is lying on the couch with my laptop,
working and reading, staring snows outside from time to time.
Since it will be colder in Minnesota,
we decide to stay in the city and not move for the next couple of months.


## Rust, China, and Blockchain

Opinions, prejudices exist along with human beings.
The Rust community seems to still anti-blockchain in general.
A blockchain or smart contract topic can never be accepted by RustFest.
By contrast, the Rust China community started
preparing Rust Conf China 2020 in Shanghai, tightly schedule in December,
with a session that gathered blockchain projects' topics.

Rust has a massive adoption in China.
Famous companies, such as Ant, Alibaba, Bytedance, Zhihu, Huawei, use Rust
but not open sourcing their projects or even share any tech details
to China dev channels.
New startups, especially blockchain startups, are heavily hiring Rust
developers with higher-than-average salaries.

The main reason is modern blockchain projects,
such as Polkadot, NEAR, Solana, Nervos choose Rust
as the first implementation of their protocols' design.
Even the oldest and classic project, Bitcoin,
is actively building Rust libraries.
Taking advantage of Ethereum's smart contract engineering history,
modern blockchains also support building with Rust on their platforms as default.

The next to expect, building smart contracts on multi chains in Rust.


## Programming Blockchain in Rust

Having being inspired by [Rust_OS](https://os.phil-opp.com/) for a long time,
I finally decided to program a toy blockchain in Rust
and share my learning journey.
[Piece by Piece: Write Readable Rust Code](/posts/write-readable-rust-code)
is the first post, and it surprisingly got feedback from the Rust community.
I feel encouraged by that and prepare the second post.

By building my toy blockchain,
I read other projects' code to learn and dive deeper and deeper
until one day, I realized that I have even made my program `cargo build` success.
I gave away all the messy code, started over
with a clean repo, and built with tiny steps each day.


## Moved My Resume off LinkedIn

My resume has been sitting on LinkedIn for several years
until LinkedIn keeps sending over non-sense notifications,
and I feel annoyed. 
I first disabled my resume for a couple days and then 
finally deleted my account.
I started a new [resume page](/resume) on my own website
and hoping it will be easier to improve and maintain.
At least no more harass reminds.

While reviewing the previous years of my career,
I didn't have any further thoughts about 
whether the next step is good or bad.
I just always choose things I'd love to do
and keep doing it until I am bored.
My career is more like a life journey 
where I see more of the world in diverse cultures.
While people, in general, assume the world doesn't change, it is stable,
so that you should plan your career or 
even your whole life on this sound land assumption.

However, the reality isn't that simple for people 
to understand. We didn't plan COVID-19 in 2020; 
we didn't plan to work remotely, lose jobs, 
or new opportunities; 
we didn't plan to wear masks every day and 
keep away from people for such a long time, 
or even longer than we can stand. 
Of course, we do not have solutions for it at the moment.

I also didn't expect I jumped into a digital nomad lifestyle 
during the travel ban. 
Anyway, enjoy the changes, enjoy the moment.


## Learning

I recently read too much code and documentation, 
and I am currently behind my
[reading plan for 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge).
Hardly believe that it's already November!

**Books**:
[Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily-ebook/dp/B075HYVP7C/)
has been on my list for a long time.
I started to give it a read this week, 
and I suddenly addicted into it.
I love how the writer tells the truth.
I read another boring novel called [Wilde Iris](https://www.amazon.com/Wilde-Iris-April-Nugent-ebook/dp/B00B3MLJG8/)
to help me sleep.

**Papers**:
I read papers about programming blockchain.
[Towards Cross-Blockchain Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07352.pdf)
is the topic matches my current interests.
For other papers I've quick viewd, I put them to the [RiB Newsletter](https://rustinblockchain.org/newsletters/)
each month.

**Blog posts**:
- [Turning One Hundred Tweets Into a Blog Post](https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/turning-one-hundred-tweets-into-a-blog-post/)
  Wezm shares his experience for moving tweets to a blog post.
  A lot of tools are introduced.
  This is a type of blog posts I like. 
  It's plain, and hands-on, easy style for daily reading, 
  and useful enough for saving-for-later.
- [The only thing that matters](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)
  "The only thing that matters for a new startup."
  I recently like some old blog posts that 
  show essential wisdom.
- [Three Layers of Evidence](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/) 
>- Data description and patterns.
>- Interpretation of descriptions and patterns.
>- Synthesis of patterns, descriptions and interpretation.


**Podcasts and videos**:
I like [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman)'s podcast very much.
Except for tech questions, he also asks philosophy-type questions, 
for instance, life meaning, to his tech guests. 
His interview style is more like chatting with an old friend, 
but not introducing a project or promoting some products. 
Some guests are shown in his channel multiple times 
while with different statuses. 
You can see how their thoughts changing, 
the world-changing from their point of view.

## Fun

**Detour**:
We went to a small town close to the Mississippi River, 
called Wabasha, a German town, hangs the German flag everywhere. 
There was somehow a competition where people seem to 
bring their most giant pumpkins in a park, 
with their names tagged on. 
Standing in these giant pumpkins feels like 
I am in a gigantic universe. 
And I first time know the Octoberfest exists, 
which is a tradition for beers and pumpkin competition. 
Wabasha creates Septoberfest base on that.

**Movies**:
We started watching a TV series, Fargo. 
A sad story happened in winter Minnesota after 
finished a movie with the same name. 
We were surprised to see that there are 
some connections between the two. 
I learned a bit of Minnesota's accent sentences: 
"you bet you", "oh, Jesus", "oh, yea", "don't you know".

**Kitchen**:
Our cooking skills are growing,
and our diet changes often.
We were into tofu in the first two weeks and cooked it
every second day as the afternoon tea snacks,
but soon were tired of it.
Recently, our interests moved to soups.
We made a lot of soups, and we love curry soups the most.
We cooked more seafood, mostly salmon and scallops,
compared to burgers and sausages previously.
We had more oats, yogurt, and bread as breakfast,
diverse types of blueberries, fresh, dried, and frozen ones as snacks.
Of course, we created new coffee drinks to
enrich our afternoon tea experience.
Our recipes get bigger.
By the way, we started beer tasting.
