`Minnesota, US`

This is a report of this week (actually just four days since
previous [Coconut Report 31](/reports/2020-11-04)),
and I am thinking of
keeping a weekly pattern with shorter content rather than
a more comprehensive monthly report,
and putting specific content into blog posts.

Rochester gets warmer this week, and the daytime is shorter.
Tree leaves fall down, and only branches are left.
Cuttipies, squirrels and bunnies, come out often
for food that is hidden in the grass.
We met our neighbor yesterday, and Brian praised
his gorgeous house.

The weather is so good that everybody is walking outdoors,
enjoying the sunshine.
We encountered many people on our walk, waved each other greetings.
The daily COVID-19 infection number grows higher too.
I expect the infection will reach a much higher record
after election celebrations.


## What I Saw This Week

During the period of US election day, everybody seems to be nervous.
China doesn’t seem to care who will be elected as
much as other countries since its economic policies
for the next decade are more focused on domestic demand.
I saw discussions on WeChat that people seem to bet on Trump a lot.
There wasn’t too much to say about Biden.
More jokes and memes, but not real information.
Some even joke about it, saying,
“I have never seen the US map for such a long time in my whole life”.

In the US, more states passed laws on drugs, e.g.,
[Oregon becomes first state to legalize magic mushrooms as more states ease drug laws in ‘psychedelic renaissance’](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/04/oregon-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-magic-mushrooms-as-more-states-ease-drug-laws.html).
In China, Ant Finance's IPO was stopped by
newly issued rules for REGULATION.
Bitcoin's price is sky high, and I lost my option bet again.

## Hacks, Writes, and Thoughts

Ok, I made my Walnuts project, the toy blockchain project, build.
And I started to play around with Polkadot ink with Brian.
We love to experiment with mainstream layer1 blockchains
with ideas about building tools for dapp developers.
Both of us are lazy in different ways,
and carefully choose what the next thing to work on is.

I moved some notes to blog posts,
hoping to write more frequently, sharing thoughts and experience
as early as possible.
I think this would help me to verify ideas quickly.
Thanks to the feedback from my
[previous programming post](/posts/write-readable-rust-code/) and
GitHub activities.


## Learning

**Blog posts**:
I don't take notes for everything.
Some blog posts are good for saving for someday,
but not useful to me at the moment.
I can easily `rg` the keyword anytime
when I need to.

**Videos**:
[The book that awakened Alan Turing's genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlQSHQXdQn4)
is a new Tibees's video, and I like her soft voice
as well as the stories she introduces.
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
is a channel for learning math in an entertaining way.
This is the type of educational video I like.
I'm drawn to the tidy graphic, fast voice speed,
and the whole video quality.
It has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/videos)
too.
