`Minnesota, US`


This is a report of this week, and I am thinking of
keeping a weekly pattern with shorter content than
a more comprehensive monthly report.

Rochester gets warmer this week, and the daytime is shorter.
Tree leaves fall down, and only branches left.
Cuttipies, squirrels and bunnies, come out often
for food that is hidden in the grass.

The weather is so good that everybody is walking outdoor,
enjoying the sunshine.
The daily COVID-19 infection number grows higher too.
I expect the infection will reach a much higher record
since several election celebrations.


## Things This Week


During the period of US election day, everybody seems to be nervous.
China doesn’t seem to care who will be elected that
much as other countries since its economic policies
for the next decade are more focused on domestic demand.
I saw discussions on WeChat that people seem to bet on Trump a lot.
There wasn’t too much to say about Biden.
More jokes, memes but not content on real information.
Some even joke about it, saying,
“I never seeing the US map for such a long time in my whole life”.

**Changes**:
In the US, more states passed laws on drugs, e.g.,

In China, Ant Finance's IPO was stopped by
newly issued rules for REGULATION.
Bitcoin's price is sky high, and I lost my option bet.
