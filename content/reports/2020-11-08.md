`Minnesota, US`

This is a report of this week (actually just four days since
previous [Coconut Report 31](/reports/2020-11-04)),
and I am thinking of
keeping a weekly pattern with shorter content than
a more comprehensive monthly report,
putting specific content into a blog post.

Rochester gets warmer this week, and the daytime is shorter.
Tree leaves fall down, and only branches left.
Cuttipies, squirrels and bunnies, come out often
for food that is hidden in the grass.
We met our neighbor yesterday, and Brian praised
his gorgeous house.

The weather is so good that everybody is walking outdoor,
enjoying the sunshine.
We encountered more people on the way walking,
waved each other greetings all the time.
The daily COVID-19 infection number grows higher too.
I expect the infection will reach a much higher record
since several election celebrations.


## What I Saw This Week

During the period of US election day, everybody seems to be nervous.
China doesn’t seem to care who will be elected that
much as other countries since its economic policies
for the next decade are more focused on domestic demand.
I saw discussions on WeChat that people seem to bet on Trump a lot.
There wasn’t too much to say about Biden.
More jokes, memes but not content on real information.
Some even joke about it, saying,
“I never seeing the US map for such a long time in my whole life”.

In the US, more states passed laws on drugs, e.g.,
[Oregon becomes first state to legalize magic mushrooms as more states ease drug laws in ‘psychedelic renaissance’](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/04/oregon-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-magic-mushrooms-as-more-states-ease-drug-laws.html)
In China, Ant Finance's IPO was stopped by
newly issued rules for REGULATION.
Bitcoin's price is sky high, and I lost my option bet.

## Hacks, Writes, and Thoughts

Ok, I made my Walnuts project, the toy blockchain project, build.
And I started to play around with Polkadot ink with Brian.
We love to experiment with mainstream layer1 blockchains
with ideas about building tooling for targetted dapp developers.
Both of us are lazy at some point,
carefully choose what the next thing to work on is.

I moved some notes to blog posts,
hoping to write more frequently, sharing thoughts and experience
as early as possible.
I think this would help me to verify ideas quickly.
Thanks to the feedback from my
[previous programming post](/posts/write-readable-rust-code/) and
GitHub activities, for instance,
the newest one I put in a [blog post](/posts/test-and-define-an-issue/).


## Learning

**Blog posts**:
I don't take notes for everything.
Some blog posts are good for saving for someday,
but not useful to me at the moment.
I can easily `rg` the keyword anytime
when I need to.

**Videos**:
[The book that awakened Alan Turing's genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlQSHQXdQn4)
is a new Tibees's video, and I like her soft voice
as well as the stories she introduced.
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
is a channel for entertainingly learning math.
This is the type of educational videos I like.
I'm drawn to the tidy graphic, fast voice speed,
and the whole video quality.
It has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/videos)
too.
