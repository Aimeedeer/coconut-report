`Minnesota, US`

It was a fulfilling week. I am enjoying programming more than ever before,
and I made progress on Rust hacking.

It's cold in Rochester, MN, and will be even colder next week.
I found out that the daylight starts at 9am and disappears at 4pm.
No wonder I slept so much.
That is human nature to follow the sun.
Sometimes there is a thin snow-like layer on the ground, reflecting lights.
But I feel it's always dark and cloudy.
We are hoping it snows next week as the forecast says.

## Hacks

This week,
I have been working on [Advent of Code][AoC] and [TbaSubstrate][tba] tests.
Playing with AoC puzzles is fun. I did two and a half AoC puzzles in Rust:

I am much more comfortable with Rust syntax now.
The experience of solving problems on my own is encouraging.
Polishing a small piece of code to make it even better feels so good.
I love high quality stuff.
Moreover, when I read others' code, to think of different approaches, it opens my mind,
which makes me feel like refactoring myself.

TbaSubstrate project uses `ink::test` macro to write Rust test functions.
So I also learned a bounch about macros because of that.

For fun, I installed Slime in Emacs and played around with Lisp!
```
(format t "Hello, world!")
```

## Reads

Finally finished the book: [The Pragmatic Programmer][bookprogrammer],
and started reading [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][bookstructure].
They both have great reputations. 
I have read half of Pragmatic Thinking and Learning,
the Chinese version. It is a relaxing read.

I had questions about how a function is executed in Rust
and how macros are processed during programming.
I read some other languages' stuff by random, such as
[Lua's paper][lua], macros in Lisp and Rust, and more.
Super interesting.

In addition to programming books, I am reading two novels this week,
and both are good.
- A crime novel: [The Redbreast][noveljo], the Chinese version
- The super famous J.R.R. Tolkien's [The Fellowship of the Ring][novelring]

[Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius][bookmarcus]
is a great book too. However, I sometimes couldn't understand the old English.
