`Minnesota, US`

I have been exciting a whole week since I started programming
AoC and [TbaSubstrate][tba] tests.
I did two and a half puzzels from AoC in Rust,
and learned a bunch of macros from writing TbaSubstrate tests.
I played a bit Lisp with Slime in Emacs,
read Lua paper, Haskell doc, and Common Lisp blog posts.
It was a fulfilled week.

## Hacks and rib.rs


## Read and learn

Finally finished the book: [The Pragmatic Programmer][bookprogrammer],
and started reading [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][bookstructure].
Both have great reputations.
I have read half of [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning][bookthinking],
Chinese version. It is a relaxing read.

I had a lot of questions of how a function is executed in Rust, and how
macros are processed in a program during my hacking.
I read some other languages' stuff by random, such as
[Lua's paper][lua], macros in Lisp and Rust, and more.
Super interesting.

In addition to programming books, I am reading two novels this week,
and both are good.
- [The Redbreast][noveljo], Chinese version, a crime novel.
- The super famous J.R.R. Tolkien's [The Fellowship of the Ring][novelring].
