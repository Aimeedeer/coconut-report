`Minnesota, US`

We moved to a new Airbnb yesterday and of course
we filled in our refrigerator with exciting beers,
which calls for more [tasting] tasks
-- a lot more to come!

It is almost the end of November and the end of 2020 as well.
Families in Rochester are starting to decorate their houses,
and we are thinking of doing ours too.
There is already a Christmas tree standing in
our living room. How lovely!

## What I Saw This Week

More covid-19 confirmed cases in Rochester,
and 900 doctors got infected. It's scary.
New infections showed up in China too. [Rust China Conf]
has to move from Shanghai, where is was
initially scheduled, to Shenzhen, a Southern city.
The geographic changes caused extra work for the organizer team
and new costs because of the venue changes.
Fortunately, there are more sponsors this year, compared to
[RustCon Asia] in 2019, so hopefully they can cover the expenses.

Crypto projects that issued their own cryptocurrencies
are loud as long as there is enough money for hype. 
By contrast, development activities and dev community
discussions are less noticeable.
Focusing on Rust projects,
I can see limited projects, such as the Ethereum client Lighthouse,
Substrate/Polkadot, and NEAR, demonstrate marked dev improvement
and regular activities.
You can find it out from their GitHub repos
or simply check the "Most Active" section in [RiB] each month.

Dev tutorials and documentation are
the primary evidence of a project's attitude
to the dev community:
how the entries are set up for developers
with different programming requirements; how well
(or bad) explained the step-by-step tutorials;
the last updated date of each page, and so on.

## Hacks, Writes, and Thoughts

More hacks these days!
I mainly hacked on [Walnuts][walnutscode] and
[Substrate ink][inknote], and I made progress with them.
Things learned are [error handling], the [cargo-expand] tool,
and other concepts in Rust programming.
I became more excited about programming in blockchain,
along with the growing knowledge I have learned. 

I have been considering PGP messages for a while
and finally updated my [PGP public key][pgpkey] with the help of Protonmail.
I am quite into Protonmail now, and 
I moved the rib.rs official email to it, too,
with the MX protocol settings.

Along the way, I wrote a bit more about
"how to pretend to be a hacker", 
adding some command lines to it. 
It might be too detailed, but I hope it's useful for someone
who doesn't know how to use a terminal properly,
like me in 2019.
Meanwhile, I updated [Study] notes. I changed its CSS, moved some
sub .org files to one single .org file, and generated
several .md files.

inspired by the sky colors and the cute moon
in the evening when we bought porter.
