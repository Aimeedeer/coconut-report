## Thoughts

Nervos has more tech content in Feb, which is produced by developers. Developers start their video channels and share more small pieces of experience often on their independent website.

RiB Newsletter only takes me 2 days of work each month to keep up those updates.  And it gets more contribution and attention.  I consider moving this site from WordPress to the GitHub page in April-May after onCKB site built, to make it more open so that people can participate more comfortably and profoundly.

Writing skill is an asset, I need to practice more.

Learned from RiB: always encourage others.
