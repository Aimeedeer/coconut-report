title: Coconut Report 15

`Utah, US`

This is a week of focusing -- less news, less messages, more classic books and articles.

I took useful notes, including thoughts about product building, and RiB community roadmap.

Staying at Utah is comfortable. I especially like the neighborhoods very well.
From walking across those beautiful houses, seeing people who exercise in front of their apartments,
I am comforted by this offline real life.
