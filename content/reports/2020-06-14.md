`Utah, US`

A ["black lives matter" protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKhMjqHNYM) happened in Provo this Saturday.

We saw a group of people around age 20 pass by our windows, with the handwritten signs of "black lives matter."
It was my first time being so close to a protest, and I was curious.

People were quiet and polite, and the protest was peaceful.
When we left, we saw a guy with a "white lives matter" sign joining in the crowd.


This week I read a bunch of whitepapers from stablecoin projects -- I love reading papers!

By reading research papers on economics and stablecoin projects, and their references, 
I learned the basic concepts. By moving one step further, to understand logic based on those concepts, 
I am slowly developing a mental model for the topic I am learning.

I will dive deeper and generate insights from notes and practice.


Other than learning about stablecoins, I read more books than last week. 

I feel a need to train and expand my memory, for which I learned new note-taking and management tools (see `Tools learned`). 
Those tools build a wiki-like knowledge network based on note-taking, with keyword connections and relative links.
That helps writing on specific topics, for example, academic research. 

Recommend a quick read on the roam theory: [A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method](https://org-roam.github.io/org-roam/manual/A-Brief-Introduction-to-the-Zettelkasten-Method.html#A-Brief-Introduction-to-the-Zettelkasten-Method), 
and I plan to use Emacs org-roam to implement my wiki-network ;)

  > As adoption increases, individuals may not store large amounts of wealth on a stable token but instead "use" it as a utility.
  > Whales still dominate both DeFi and dApps.
  > If an app or utility is unlikely to capture them early on in their growth cycle - 
  > they may likely not see much traction due to the small market that crypto today holds
  > DAI does have a higher average transaction per month count due to the fact that it is used for use-cases other than exchanging alone.
- [Stablecoins](https://defirate.com/stablecoins/)
  > It’s worth noting that virtually all reputable stablecoins are based on Ethereum. 
  > While this may not seem like a huge issue in the short term, 
  > interoperability will likely play a huge role in the eventual success of blockchain-based systems at large. 
  > To this point, it’s important for existing stablecoin projects to embrace new emerging protocols with open arms.

  > A common pattern is to begin a piece with a problem or a mystery or a promise. 
  > Resolving the problem or mystery or fulfilling the promise is what defines the purpose of the piece. 
  > Of course, your writing may take the reader on a journey, gradually refining (and perhaps redefining) the purpose. 
  > But it nonetheless remains with the reader and the author. "Destroy the One Ring" is our obsession in The Lord of the Rings. 
  > The problem confronted in Where Do Good Ideas Come From? needs no elaboration. 
  > The Language Instinct promises to explore the idea that much of the structure of language is innate to our brains, not learned. 
  > Each book focuses relentlessly on its purpose.
  >
  > There are several elements to it: (1) Primary note-taking; (2) Queueing; (3) Refactoring and organization. You need to get good at all.

  > Read the abstract (if provided)

  > Read the introduction.

  > Read the conclusion.

  > Skim the middle, looking at section titles, tables, figures, etc.—try to get a feel for the style and flow of the article.
  >> Is it methodological, conceptual, theoretical (verbal or mathematical), empirical, or something else?
  >>
  >> Is it primarily a survey, a novel theoretical contribution, an empirical application of an existing theory or technique, a critique, or something else?
  >
  > Go back and read the whole thing quickly, skipping equations, most figures and tables.
  >
  > Go back and read the whole thing carefully, focusing on the sections or areas that seem most important.
  > Once you’ve grasped the basic argument the author is trying to make, critique it!
