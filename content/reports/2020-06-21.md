`Utah, US`

The Economist this week has excellent writings. 
The two articles about Amazon gave critical and reasonable opinions,
sharp as usual. Highly recommend.
- The genius of Amazon
- Amazon: And on the second day…

I started collecting classic posts on hacking, OS, and file system,
such as, the Linux documentary, Unix story, GNU, etc. 
I realized that there is still so much to learn.
As a result, I went back to study Computer Science on Youtube.
More importantly, I learned to be patient with my baby steps practicing. 

I wrote more code this week, practice in Python and Rust, 
and I expect to write another bot tool for rib sourcing 
-- to build the hacker mind by doing real stuff.

This week, my partner and I began to take videos while we were cooking.
We have 3 draft videos so far, and we had fun!

Emotions, like the stocks market, go up and down often.
Short-term movements in stocks are a sign of market sentiment, 
as emotions express our concerns.
Following the long-term value is easy said than done.
We human beings are easily distracted by things in front of us.

> Memory is far more important than people tend to think: 
> It plays a role in nearly every part of cognition, including problem-solving, creative work, and meta-cognition. 
> The flip side is that memory systems themselves want to grow into other types of tools – 
> tools for reading, tools for problem-solving, tools for creating, tools for attention management. 
> That said, we don’t yet know what memory systems want to be. 
> To reiterate: memory systems are in their infancy.

> Develop a mental model of how it works.
>
> Pick a small feature to change or add.
>
> Make, test, debug, and document your change.
>
> Now, ask yourself: do I understand this entire program?
>
> Note: you should specifically not try to read the entire program.
> You will just exhaust and frustrate yourself if you do that. 
> Instead, use the module structure of the code to zero in on just the part you need to understand.
>
> Along the way, you will learn things about how the whole program fits together.
>
> To train yourself, start small. If possible, first do the incremental-hacking cycle as an exercise on very small programs or scripts, 10-50 lines.	
> When you master that level, go to the order of magnitude, 1000-5000 lines.
>
> Once your design sense (your equivalent of musical ear) is activated, 
> you'll often find that you start refactoring each program you work on as rapidly as the third or fourth time around the incremental-hacking cycle.
