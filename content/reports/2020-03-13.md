## Thoughts

In general, wechat articles from blockchain projects have less than 1k views, Nervos, web3, yikuai have around 300 views each; People in Parity have more page views, about 800. It seems projects are active but not a lot of community activities or discussions.

Talked to a blockchain dev, we agreed on the reality that most blockchain groups are not active. You don't see community people ask questions often.

Learn to write a better report.

Utah is beautiful and very quiet. I love here and might stay longer to avoid travel at this outbreak period time.
