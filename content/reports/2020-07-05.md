`Utah, US`

This week, I joined a hackathon, HackFS.
It's a 30 days online hackathon, in which you build stuff on IPFS and Filecoin.
This must be the first time I participate in a hackathon as a hacker,
rather than an organizer. Exciting!

The experience so far is pretty good. The event is very well organized.
Clear documentation, email follow up,
staking to participate,
slack channels for info sharing, pre-team-up spreadsheet, and so on.

I also very much like the hands-on workshops.
Speakers shared their demos and sometimes live coding.
I love to see some mistakes happen during the coding -- it's a natural way to open conversations.
Hackers were active, either asking questions in workshops, or sharing thoughts in the slack channel.

Oraganizers are always there to be supportive -- a friendly community.

	    
Inspired by the two books **Flow** and **Peak**, I finally wrote a blog post in Chinese this week, in which I shared my practical experience as a barista and a programmer.

We published Rib newsletter #13 this week, and found fewer exciting things that happened last month.
Even some of the projects stopped updating their official blogs or Twitter.

This newsletter post got flagged (dead) on Hacker News (again).
