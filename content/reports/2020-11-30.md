`Minnesota, US`

Still in Rochester, MN.
It has been surprisingly sunny days this week.
I started missing my apartment in Hangzhou and hoping both of us
could enter China soon.
Having been in the US since February,
I almost forget the polluted air of Hangzhou or the not-drinkable tap water.

China seems to be the safest place at the moment.
However, as the vaccine hasn't been produced and widely distributed to the whole
world, it's been and will still be a worrying time for us all.
Perhaps waiting and keeping away from people
is the cautions and responsible choice.

I had a typical American style thanksgiving day here, with a soccer game
playing on the TV, a meal with roasted chicken instead of turkey.


## What I Saw This Week

[Rust China Conf][rustchina] changes the venue to Shenzhen, finally.
It seems to work fine.

I recently started reading a book,
[The America-China Divide: The Race to Control the World][bookac],
talking about China's rising power from an American's perspective.
By reading only 13% of the book so far, I found that the writer's opinions
are more like literary criticism rather than reasoning-based demonstrative.
It's good to read but not a need to believe all of the content.

For example, this scenario can not be real from my aspect.
> Baidu may well become the world’s predominant search engine
and Weibo may supplant Facebook as the world’s largest social media platform.

Baidu has a trust problem for a million years as I can remember,
and tech people in China use Google, Bing, Duckduckgo alternative search engines.
More of my friends stopped using Weibo a long time ago
that I hardly remember when.
Like Weibo, social media platforms are strictly censored in China,
which prevents its adoption in other countries.
Not to mention who control the database.

The Economist this week gives a great article about people's interests
in China at the academic level decline:
[As China’s power waxes, the West’s study of it is waning][economistpost].

> The country began tightening restrictions on work there
by western academics.

It's worth reading.
By contrast, investing in China and assets management
are more popular topics that attract global attention.

## Hacks, Writes, and Thoughts

There is no progress on my [Walnuts] project or writing this week.
More time was occupied by [Substrate and ink][inknote].

I wanted to pick up the [BigAnnouncement][tba] project again and implement
it on Substrate.
I use `cargo contract` to create a new default smart contract on Substrate,
and currently stop at the String type in the `no_std` scenario.

I am glad to see more discussions in the RiB Telegram group.
Meanwhile, we see the demand for sponsoring the RiB, for which
we will ask for our readers' attitude before the decision.
To make sure to put the RiB community on notice
that everybody is participating.

Although economic pain exists with open source projects,
individual maintainers have to endure maintaining work without payment.
We don't want it to be happening in the RiB community, though.
We want to provide compensation to contributors while we can,
but we do not tone up any money motive.
We hope people hack on things they like and also get paid
for their contribution.
It shall be a means rather than an end.

Someday, RiB will grow up to a more exciting community for hackers,
the homestead for Rust and blockchain developers.

## The Silly Moment

It snowed this Tuesday. As usual, I made myself coffee
and yogurt bowl right after I woke up.
I put my coffee on the desk beside the couch and
walked out of the front door to take snowing photos.

It was cold, and I only wore a thin sweater, skinny pants,
and socks. I stood on the porch, quickly shooted photos,
and planned to go inside.
Suddenly, I realized that the door handle didn't' move at all --
it is precisely the same type as the back door
that can be opened from two sides.
I tried again and confirmed that I couldn't open it.

In a second, the scene from the “Fargo” TV show
flashed in front of my eyes:
a guy was freezing to death
in the snowing season.
Secondly, I started to miss the coffee I
have just made that was still sitting on the desk…

I buzzed the doorbell, and it seemed broken.
There was a sign aside that says it doesn't work.
Oh well. I don't think I can call my partner by phone
because he rarely catches his phone calls (and me too).
However, I tried calling him anyway.
In the meanwhile, I kept kicking the door. 

Nothing happened.

I was freezing. I don't want to die like the dead man in Fargo.
I want to try to kick the backdoor, and luckily his bedroom window
was there too. I knocked on that window and the door,
and I heard some noise! I survived.

I said you saved my life.
