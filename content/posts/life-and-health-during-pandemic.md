My partner has stayed in Mayo Clinic for a couple of days, and the hospital
doesn't allow visitors during covid-19.
It's somehow lucky that the situation was happened in Rochester, MN,
with the world-famouse hospital around, but not in Montana, or other
places on our roadtrip.
At this point, we were glad that we are still in the US that he can
communicate with doctors about his body as well as the insurance.

I can't imagine if we both are living alone, like some of my other friends
currently during the lockdown, what should a person do to deal with
the physical and mental situations.
Human begings are social animals, we mostly need other people around
for the proof of our existance, for the comfort, for meanings or meaningless.
Even though, as an individual, we seems to have everything we need for daily life,
but many of us would still feel lonely easily.

If there is no covid-19, a person can just go to a coffee shop or a bar
to meet strangers; or join in some events with specific topics s/he probably
is interested in.
That is the go-to activities if the loneliness hit.
Nowadays, because of covid-19, a person can't even meet his/her family.
The default activities turned to be roaming in social media and then
feel even more lonely.
That's hurting.

Connecting to friends by messaging or video calls are strongly needed.
Sometimes I can feel that mild anger if I didn't reply to my friends
in a period of time.

Personally, I am not into messaging, social media or other means of online social.
I would read to bored, then watch a movie or choose something I can do it alone quietly.
