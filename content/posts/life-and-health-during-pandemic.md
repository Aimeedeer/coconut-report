My partner has stayed in Mayo Clinic for a couple of days, and the hospital
doesn't allow visitors during covid-19.
It's somehow lucky that the situation has happened in Rochester, MN,
with the world-famous hospital around, but not in Montana or other
places on our road trip.
At this point, we were glad that we are still in the US that he can
communicate with doctors alone about his body as well as the insurance state.

I can't imagine if we both live alone, like some of my other friends
currently during the lockdown, what should a person do to deal with
the physical and mental situations.
Human beings are social animals. We mostly need other people around
for the proof of our existance, for comfort, for meanings, or meaningless.
Even though, as an individual, we seem to have everything we need for daily life,
but many of us would still feel lonely easily.

If there is no covid-19, a person can just go to a coffee shop or a bar
to meet strangers; or join in some events with specific topics s/he probably
is interested in.
That is the go-to activity if the loneliness hits.
Nowadays, because of covid-19, a person can't even meet his/her family.
The default activities turned to be roaming in social media and then
feel even more lonely.
That's hurting.

Struggling as social-distancing keeps us away from our friends and families.
Connecting to friends by messaging or video calls are strongly needed.

As personally I am not into messaging, social media or, other means of online social,
I can sometimes feel that mild anger from friends if
I didn't reply ontime as they expected.

I would read to bored, then watch a movie or choose something I can do it alone quietly.
