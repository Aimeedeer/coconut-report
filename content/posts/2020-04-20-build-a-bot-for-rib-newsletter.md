title: Build a Bot for RiB Newsletter
---

I always want to make repeating works automatically. After several months working on generating Projects updating for RiB Newsletter, I wanted to build a bot to speed up this workflow.

For the RiB Newsletter, there are sections: intro, thanks, project spotlight, projects update, learning, interesting things, events, and career.

TODO: explain each section content and how to generate it

There is a rib-bible as the resource guideline, each month, we follow the rib-bible to check updates, and pick up those informative content as well as interesting pieces. It took me one day to make all the content.

To be honest, I don't enjoy making newsletters, I think the process is pretty much boring. So I need a bot to do that not-fun-at-all stuff for me.
