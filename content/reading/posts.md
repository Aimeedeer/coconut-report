## Economics

- [Debt is Coming](https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/)
  - Speculative investment, with ambitious but inexact expectations of financial return, is important fuel for founders who build the unknown future. However, investors and oper\

an institutional expression of this tension.
