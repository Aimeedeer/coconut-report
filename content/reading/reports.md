- [2020 Q1 Dapp Market Report by DappReview](https://dapp.review/article/251)
  - Compared to 2019 Q1:
    - The transaction volume of Finance dapps reached $2.95 billion, an increase of 1,743%
    - The transaction volume of Exchange dapps reached $2.34 billion, an increase of 430%
  - In terms of active addresses, the average DAA (Daily Active Addresses) of Ethereum in 2020 Q1 was 16,763, an increase of 55.86%. Most of the growth is driven by Finance dapps and Risk dapps (aka, Ponzi Scheme, eg. Doubleway, MillionMoney). Excluding Risk dapps, the average DAA is 12,505, with the growth of 23.55%.
  - The total number of Ethereum active addresses in 2020 Q1 is 422,871, and 243,252 of them are Risk dapps users, accounting for 52.29% of the total, mainly from Doubleway and MillionMoney. From our observation, a large number of these addresses playing Ponzi schemes are bots trying to manipulate the users/volume stats.
  - As more and more use cases of DeFi, a total of 31,299 addresses have interacted with Financial dapps, increased by 234.86%. Meanwhile, despite the transaction volume of the Casino dapps being almost flat, the number of active addresses has increased by 39.88%.

  - A review and analysis of DeFi protocols and performance in Q1 2020 by Alethio Analytics.
  - There are two ways to measure funds locked in DeFi: ETH locked and USD locked.
    - 1. ETH locked measures the amount of ETH and WETH (ETH represented as an ERC-20
token) that has been sent to these smart contracts.
    - 2. USD locked measures the USD value of the funds locked in DeFi smart contracts. USD
locked is directly correlated with the market price of ETH. Even if the ETH locked in DeFi
amount stays the same, the USD locked value would increase or decrease as the USD price
of ETH changes.
  -  On January 30, the Ethereum community witnessed the greatest amount of ETH
locked in DeFi protocols: 3,178,695 million ETH (see addendum A). 81% of ETH locked (2.5m ETH)
was attributed to Maker (MCD + SCD), and 12% (376k) was attributed to Compound.
