I build blockchain projects in Rust and I have been running [Rust in
Blockchain][rib] since 2019. For years earlier, I build developer
communities globally for the software and people I love.


## Skills

- Rust programming in the crypto field
- Engaging open source contributors
- Developing communication strategies,
  across cultural boundaries, in English and Chinese

## Experience

#### Projects | Programmer | 2020.04 - Now

**[RealTPS][realtps]**
measures the current number of transactions per second
committed by various blockchains.

**[Treasure Tree][tt]**.
A real-world treasure hunt game where the treasures are represented as
QR codes in the physical world, and NFTs in the virtual.

**[The Captain's Ascent][contract-game]**.
A game of smart contract programming, for people to learn smart
contract programming in Rust.

**[The Big Announcement][tba]**.
This is a tiny dapp built on the Ethereum testnet.  It is my first
blockchain programming project.

#### [Rust in Blockchain][rib] | Creator & Editor | 2019.06 - Now

I created Rust in Blockchain as a monthly newsletter and a community
for Rust and blockchain developers.  I write most of the blog posts
and curate each newsletter. 
[RiB is One Year Old!][rib-oneyear] is an overview of this project.

#### [Nervos Network][nervos] | Developer Relations | 2018.07 - 2020.03

**Building Impressions**.
I joined Nervos as a business developer for
its blockchain framework [CITA](https://github.com/citahub/cita).
My work started with distributing Nervos's fundraising news.
I provided strategic event planning, particularly for dev meetups.	
Nervos has built a good reputation as an innovative tech team
in the Chinese blockchain community.

**Content Marketing**.
I managed content planning and distribution on
Chinese dev platforms, such as
[Rust China][rustcc], [SegmentFault][sf], [InfoQ][inq], etc;
general community platforms [Zhihu][zhihu], [Jianshu][jianshu];
and blockchain media platforms like [Bihu][bihu].

**Engaging Developers**.
I built relationships with Rust developers in Europe and China.
I advocated Nervos blockchain architecture to other Rust devs,
and encouraged them to build on Nervos.
I organized and participated in dev conferences, such as
RustCon Asia, RustFest Rome & RustFest Barcelona, RubyChina, etc.
I started Rust in Blockchain meetups and workshops in San Francisco,
Berlin, and Hangzhou, China.

The latest dev conference is [RustCon Asia 2019][rustcon].
I wrote blog posts, [Why Rust][post-whyrust]
and [A Close Encounter with Rust Community][post-rustcon],
about it.

**Recruiting Developers**.
After engaging with developers for so long,
I naturally changed my role to recruiting them.
I created the recruiting process and managed interviews.

#### HackathonCN | Business Development | 2017.05 - 2018.06

I ran hackathons for companies.
Our clients included: [KONE](https://www.kone.com/),
[INESA](https://www.inesa-it.com/), Microsoft Shanghai.

#### [SegmentFault][sf] | Marketing Manager | 2015.07 - 2017.05

**Engaging Developers**.
I built engagement between junior and senior developers,
and between developers and organizations.
I optimized the interactions between organizations and talent.

**Developing Business**.
I expanded connections and brought
sponsors to support developer communities.

**Operating Dev Events**.
I planned and organized dev events such as SegmentFault D-Day meetups,
two [SFDC][event-sfdc] conferences, and hackathons in China.
The most notable hackathon series is [Anyone Can Code][post-hackathon].

[My profile page][sf-profile] on SegmentFault has some old posts (in Chinese).

#### Excellent Coffee | Founder & General Manager | 2010.08 - 2014.09

I operated a coffee business and its local community.
I was also the principal barista and know
how to make superb coffee in at least two dozen styles.

#### [Iflytek][iflytek] | Software Developer | 2007.07 - 2010.05

I wrote C# and Java for government projects,
including an office management system for a telecom company,
and analytics for law enforcement.
