title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m Aimee Zhu.
I build blockchain stuff, and I am learning Rust programming.

I'm a long-term dev-community builder
that I operate and advocate tech business to software developers.
For which, I do [**consulting**](/consulting) 
with my expertise in developer-oriented marketing.

My up-to-date [**resume**](/resume) shows the detailed experience.
My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimeezhu/) is available too.

### Current Hacks

I created and maintain [Rust in Blockchain](https://rustinblockchain.org/)(RiB),
a resource center for #Rust and #blockchain developers,
with a newsletter that publishes each month.
RiB has been running since June 2019, and keeps growing.

[The Big Announcement](https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement)
is a tiny Ethereum dapp that was created on HackFS.
I plan to implement it on other blockchains
to gain the experience of building dapps and tooling.

Lately, I started another project, **Implementing a PoW Blockchain in Rust**,
and I will [blog](/posts) about it slowly.

For general efforts, state updates, and thoughts,
I record them in [Coconut Reports](../../reports),
which started in February 2020.
It was a weekly report from #0 to #29,
and is a monthly report since #30.
I also write [essays in Chinese](https://newhacker.org) randomly.

### Favorite Stuff

I use terminal Emacs for almost everything on my laptop,
including note-taking, programming, and writing. 
The Org-mode is powerful.

My everyday drinks are coffee and alcohol. 
I love hand drip Kenya and always try to find new, fresh
roasted coffee beans, whereas I travel and stay.
Belgian beer and single malt Scotch are my favorite
drinking alcohol.

[Cocoverse](https://cocoverse.com) is the adventure space
for my partner and I record our shared experience.
We experiment with silly ideas there too.
