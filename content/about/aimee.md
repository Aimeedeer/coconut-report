## Hello!

I’m Aimee (阿敏). I build products and developer communities.

Previously I was a developer and then a barista. I love tech, coffee, Belgian beer, and photography.

I created [Rust in Blockchain](https://rustinblockchain.org/), organized RustCon Asia 2019, and several hackathons.
I listed the [projects](about/projects) I made or participated in.

For day to day efforts, I maintain a lovely `Coconut Report` which is updated each week.
