Since I moved more work to the weekend, I would change the reporting day to Sunday.

I have been talking to friends in China, Italy, Berlin, Australia and the US, most of us are worried because of the COVID-19 but have to calm down and support each other.

I wrote a simple blog post in Chinese today, feeling it was big progress -- started!
