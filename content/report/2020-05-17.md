`Utah, US`

This week, I stopped checking the phone every day, especially not to check messages.

I was slightly nervous for the first 2 days, then relieved later.
And now I feel quite comfortable just spending time on my laptop (Terminal Emacs & web browser), and 2 kindles.
I do check messages though, maybe once every 3-5 days.

Life becomes very simple. And I have more time to read and think.
