`Utah, US`


This week, I exercised more outdoors. We discovered a beautiful campus nearby, and we enjoyed an hour of walking per day there.
Check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aimeedeer/) for photos and videos. I love the bells very much.

The weather here is so lovely. It gets light at about 7am and gets dark at around 9pm. 
It's sunny most of the time, and the air is fairly clean.
It rained this weekend, and we walked out in the rain, enjoying the pleasant smell of earth and plants.

I finished two biographies this week, Franklin and Edison. 
I like the first part of Franklin's story, of how he grew up and the efforts he made to achieve his dreams.
But I was disappointed that in the rest of the book he praised himself so much.
Anyway, he was a great man at that time.

Edison's biography focuses more on his experience but not Edison's thoughts.
He has quite inspiring stories. I love how he managed his invention patterns, and how he lived like a real entrepreneur.
Though he was a good father.

I guess I would reread their stories someday. Great books are worth rereading.

With the help of [GTD Processing Workflow](https://lifedev.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GTD-flowchart.pdf), I chose reading pieces more carefully.

Since there were more and more reading notes and thoughts came out, I wrote much more than before. 
However, it will take me a lot more time and effort to learn how to write better.
