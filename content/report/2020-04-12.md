#### How to maintain your coffee grinder

If you make coffee every day -- use your coffee grinder every day -- I would suggest you clean your grinder every month or at least every second month.

I'll recommend a natural way, also because I am lazy, that I don't want to keep extra stuff, and I don't like complex processes.

With the guess that everybody would have rice at home, even in the COVID-19 period. You can just put a handful of rice in the grinder -- make sure there is no other hard objects like sand in the rice -- grind the rice to absorb the standing coffee oil in the grinder. Then add in freshly roasted coffee beans after that to clean the rice power.

To do that, you will have a very fresh coffee every day!
