` Location: Utah, US`

` Timezone: UTC-6`


#### **The goals for this week are:**
- Build-a-bot programming practice: to generate new open issues
- Make the first grant happen: grants on CKB
- Draft of the business plan
  -  Market research on recruiting

This week, I tried to build a bot based on Brian's ribbot, in Rust. Read a bunch of documentations and onboard articles. I had questions on `mut`.
Learned how to take notes during programming practice -- from Brian.
Learned hot to generate local docs by `yarn docs` to read ckb-sdk-js easily.


## Delivery

#### Business

#### Build on CKB

- Made testnet and devnet run, and Brian posted [Experience report - first time building and running CKB](https://talk.nervos.org/t/experience-report-first-time-building-and-running-ckb/4518)
- Research on exsiting CKB SDKs

#### Programming

- Registered a python course
- Read Rust docs


#### Efforts

Built the Coconut report to Hugo site, it can be visited by [impl.dev](https://impl.dev)

For rust & blockchain:
- Read Eth 2.0, rust projects for RiB
- Blockchain VMs list

For blockchain grants opportunities:
- Web3 grants products
- Nervos wishlist

## Interesting things

#### How to maintain your coffee grinder

If you make coffee every day -- use your coffee grinder every day -- I would suggest you clean your grinder every month or at least every second month.

I'll recommend a natural way, also because I am lazy, that I don't want to keep extra stuff, and I don't like complex processes.

With the guess that everybody would have rice at home, even in the COVID-19 period. You can just put a handful of rice in the grinder -- make sure there is no other hard objects like sand in the rice -- grind the rice to absorb the standing coffee oil in the grinder. Then add in freshly roasted coffee beans after that to clean the rice power.

To do that, you will have a very fresh coffee every day!

#### Got a unicorn coverall from Jane

Very sweet and inspiring gift. I couldn't stop jumping around inside the small apartment.
