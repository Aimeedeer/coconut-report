### Programming

I am learning programming, and have built some stuff:

- [Piece by Piece: Write Readable Rust Code](/posts/write-readable-rust-code/)
  is my first post that shares my Rust programming experience.
- [The Big Announcement][tba] 
  is a tiny Ethereum dapp that I created during [HackFS][hackfs].
  I plan to implement it on other blockchains
  to gain experience building dapps and tooling.
- [Rust in Blockchain][rib]
  is a community-contributed resource center for Rust
  and blockchain developers,
  with a newsletter that publishes every month.
  I built the website and the GitHub contributing workflow.

### Communication Strategies

I provide insight and strategy for building developer communities.
Here is general-purpose information:
- [Thoughts on Developer Community Building][post-dev-thoughts]
  is an article I wrote for Nervos team.
  In this article, I analyzed many blockchain projects' content marketing
  that is focused on developers.
  I gave action suggestions at the end of it.
- Nervos Bi-weekly Reports in [Chinese](https://talk.nervos.org/search?q=Nervos%20%E5%8F%8C%E5%91%A8%E6%8A%A5)
  and [English](https://talk.nervos.org/tag/nervos-report).
  I proposed this idea and helped to operate until it's formed.
  The content wasn't written by me.
- [Nervos CKB Development Update](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/tagged/development-updates).
  I persuaded the dev team to share development activities
  with community developers.
  It also benefits the marketing team by providing detailed information.
- [CKB Daily](https://ckbdaily.substack.com/) is a dev channel in Chinese,
  shares Nervos CKB technology in bit-size.
- [Nervos Forum](https://talk.nervos.org).
  I insisted on opening a forum for developers, and it helps with
  generating community content naturally.

### Event Strategies and Operation

- Nervos
  - [RustCon Asia 2019][rustcon] is the first Rust community conference in China.
    It attracted more than 300 Rust developers in Asia,
    with speakers came from overseas.
    It was a big party for Rust developers in China and for
    projects that adopted or plan to adopt Rust.
    The conference bridged Rust western community and Rust China community.  
  - Rust in Blockchain meetups, SF, Berlin, Hangzhou, China.
    This is a series of meetups organized for building global connections,
    with the common topics on Rust and blockchain. 
    We connected great developers, and some of them showed up
    on other events or as podcast guests.  
  - Rust in Blockchain workshops during SF blockchain week.

    was a weekly dev meetup created for Nervos community.
    It successfully engaged developers and built a good reputation.

    After Nervos announced fundraising news,
    we planned the first round of meetups in many cities in China
    and started building the community.

    I proposed many series of meetups with different branding and topics.
    This one got a wilder reach, and the "Beyond Consensus"
    is still in use afterward.
- SegmentFault
  - [Anyone Can Code Hackathon][post-hackathon] in three cities in China.
  It was the first global level hackathon that is organized by SegmentFault.
