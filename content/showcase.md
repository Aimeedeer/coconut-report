### Programming

I am learning programming, and have built some stuff:

- [Piece by Piece: Write Readable Rust Code](/posts/write-readable-rust-code/)
  is my first post that shares my Rust programming experience.
- [The Big Announcement][tba] 
  is a tiny Ethereum dapp that I created during [HackFS][hackfs].
- [Rust in Blockchain][rib]
  is a community-contributed resource center for Rust
  and blockchain developers,
  with a newsletter that publishes every month.
  I built the website and the GitHub contributing workflow.

### Communication Strategies

I provide insight and strategy for building developer communities.
Here is a list of published works.
- [Thoughts on Developer Community Building][post-dev-thoughts]
  is an article I wrote for Nervos team.
  In this article, I analyzed many blockchain projects' content marketing
  that is focused on developers.
  I gave action suggestions at the end of it.
- Proposals for Nervos team
  - Nervos Bi-weekly Reports in [Chinese](https://talk.nervos.org/search?q=Nervos%20%E5%8F%8C%E5%91%A8%E6%8A%A5)
    and [English](https://talk.nervos.org/tag/nervos-report).
    I started it and helped establish its structure.
  - [Nervos CKB Development Update](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/tagged/development-updates).
    I persuaded the dev team to share development activities
    with community developers.
    It also benefits the marketing team by providing detailed information.
  - [CKB Daily](https://ckbdaily.substack.com/),
    I created this dev channel in Chinese in order to
    share Nervos CKB technology in bite-size.
  - [Nervos Forum](https://talk.nervos.org).
    I proposed this online communication channel
    It is also a knowledge base for newcomers to learn from.
