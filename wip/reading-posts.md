## Economics

  - Speculative investment, with ambitious but inexact expectations of financial return, is important fuel for founders who build the unknown future. However, investors and operators are often deeply misaligned: investors think in bets, while operators think in consequences. The relationship is tense, but can be explosively productive. The VC model is an institutional expression of this tension.

  - The main bucket is obviously the content: 
    - about two stories a day, exclusive stories that people aren’t going to be able to get elsewhere, 
    - delivered into people’s inboxes as well as posted online. That’s obviously the most important part.
  - Second to that is the community. 
  - That includes the online community on TheInformation.com, where we have an active group of contributors who add comments to articles. 
  - LESSIN:
    - The first thing is that they have to have a track record of doing really tough, important stories. A lot of reporters romanticize doing deep investigative pieces or breaking big news or writing truly original analysis, but I’ve found that if they don’t have a track record of doing those stories, they’re not as good a fit.
    - The track record of those stories is more important than the subject matter. 
    - We’ve hired fabulous reporters who, prior to joining us, hadn’t covered tech — they’d covered real estate or something else, but their stories really stood out. That was more important than hiring reporters who had just been on the tech beat for a really long time.
    - Also, I think all good reporters have to be pretty tenacious and not give up. There’s a lot of pushback these days from companies and sources and all sorts of people who really mislead reporters constantly, particularly with stories that are tough about their business. 
    - It’s really important to stand firm. You have to have a really thick skin for the kinds of stories we do.

## Reading and Writing

- [Stab a Book, the Book Won't Die](https://craigmod.com/essays/media_accounting/)
- [How to Take Smart Notes: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/smart-notes)
- [Notes on Writing](https://github.com/mnielsen/notes-on-writing/blob/master/notes_on_writing.md)
  - A common pattern is to begin a piece with a problem or a mystery or a promise. 
  - Resolving the problem or mystery or fulfilling the promise is what defines the purpose of the piece. 
  - Of course, your writing may take the reader on a journey, gradually refining (and perhaps redefining) the purpose. 
  - But it nonetheless remains with the reader and the author. "Destroy the One Ring" is our obsession in The Lord of the Rings. 
  - The problem confronted in Where Do Good Ideas Come From? needs no elaboration. 
  - The Language Instinct promises to explore the idea that much of the structure of language is innate to our brains, not learned. 
  - Each book focuses relentlessly on its purpose.
  - There are several elements to it: (1) Primary note-taking; (2) Queueing; (3) Refactoring and organization. You need to get good at all.
- [How to Read an Academic Article](https://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/)
  - Read the abstract (if provided)
  - Read the introduction.
  - Read the conclusion.
  - Skim the middle, looking at section titles, tables, figures, etc.—try to get a feel for the style and flow of the article.
    - Is it methodological, conceptual, theoretical (verbal or mathematical), empirical, or something else?
    - Is it primarily a survey, a novel theoretical contribution, an empirical application of an existing theory or technique, a critique, or something else?
  - Go back and read the whole thing quickly, skipping equations, most figures and tables.
  - Go back and read the whole thing carefully, focusing on the sections or areas that seem most important.
  - Once you’ve grasped the basic argument the author is trying to make, critique it!
