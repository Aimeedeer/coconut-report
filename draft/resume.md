Aimee Zhu | aimeez@pm.me

I am passionate about software technologies.
I run [Rust in Blockchain][rib] since 2019, and 
I am currently programming a blockchain in the Rust language,
for which, I [blog](/posts) about it step by step.

Previously, I specialize in developer community building, 
and my expertise lies in an in-depth understanding of developers
as well as the tech industry.

Skills:
- Critical analytical thinking 
- Excelled at problem solving
- Strong execution to achieve business goals
- Writing in English and Chinese

## Career in Brief

- 5 years (2015 - 2020) developer community building & marketing managment
- 4 years (2010 - 2014) coffee business operation
- 3 years (2007 - 2010) software programming

My career direction seemed disconnected.
It began with software programming, writing
object-oriented languages, C# and Java.
For some reason, I fell in love with Espresso coffee
and soon jumped into the coffee business for a while.
To satisfy my curiosity about technology,
I went back to the software world again
by building developer communities for businesses.

## Experience

#### Current Projects | Builder | 2020.04 - Now

**Implementing a PoW Blockchain in Rust**.
This is a project for newcomers to learn
blockchain programming in Rust language.
I am currently writing code and taking notes for it.

**[The Big Announcement][tba]**.
This is a tiny project built on Ethereum testnet.
I gained the first blockchain programming experience from here.
This project isn't finished yet.
I plan to build the same functionality dapp on other layer1 blockchains
to explore the possibility of building dev tools
base on multiple blockchains.

#### [Rust in Blockchain][rib] | Creator & Editor | 2019.06 - Now

Rust in Blockchain was created as a monthly newsletter for
Rust and blockchain developers.
It was hosted on WordPress and then is hosting on GitHub
for community-driven project vision.
I built the website and keep improving it.

I wrote most of the blog posts, and curated each newsletter.
I maintain all the relative resources on GitHub
and network connections.
[RiB is One Year Old!][rib-oneyear] is an overview of
this newsletter.

#### [Nervos Network][nervos] | Developer Relations | 2018.07 - 2020.03

**Building Impressions**.
I joined Nervos as a business developer for
its blockchain framework CITA.
My actual work started with managing funding news distribution
for Nervos.
I provided strategic event planning, for instance, 
several rounds and multiple types of dev meetups, 
with a growing marketing team.
Nervos has built pretty good impressions as an innovative tech team
in several China dev communities
and new blockchain communities.

**Content Marketing**.
I managed content planning and distributing on
Chinese dev platforms, such as
[Rust China][rustcc], [SegmentFault][sf], [InfoQ][inq], etc;
general community platforms [Zhihu][zhihu], [Jianshu][jianshu];
and blockchain media platforms, for instance, [Bihu][bihu].

**Engaging Developers**.
We deeply engaged with developers in China, and
built good relationships with Rust European as well as
Rust China community.
I managed connections with RustFest, RustChina devs, 
and Nervos dev team, 
advocated Nervos blockchain architecture to other Rust devs,
encouraged devs to build on Nervos.
I organized and participated in dev conferences, such as
RustCon Asia, RustFest Rome & RustFest Barcelona, RubyChina, etc.
I started Rust in Blockchain meetups and workshops in San Francisco,
Berlin, and Hangzhou, China.

The latest dev conference is [RustCon Asia 2019][rustcon].
I wrote blog posts [Why Rust][post-whyrust] 
and [A Close Encounter with Rust Community][post-rustcon].

**Recruiting Developers**.
I naturally moved my role to help recruiting developers
since I was the only non-dev who  understand developers the most.
I issued the recruiting process and managed interviews
with developers.

#### HackathonCN | Business Development | 2017.05 - 2018.06

I simply ran hackathons for companies' innovations.
Part of our clients are: [KONE](https://www.kone.com/),
[INESA](https://www.inesa-it.com/), Microsoft Shanghai.

#### [SegmentFault][sf] | Marketing Manager | 2015.07 - 2017.05

**Engaging Developers**.
I built engagement for junior developers and senior developers,
for developers and software companies.
I optimized interactive experience between business and talents.

**Developing Business**.
Expanding connections with software companies and dev teams.
Brought growing tech sponsors for our dev events.

**Operating Dev Events**.
I planned and organized dev events such as D-Day meetups,
conferences [SFDC][event-sfdc],
and hackathons in China.
The notable hackathon series is [Anyone Can Code][post-hackathon].

[My profile page][sf-profile] on SegmentFault has some old posts (in Chinese).

#### Excellent Coffee | Founder & General Manager | 2010.08 - 2014.09

I operated the coffee business and the local community
and built connections between clients.

Technically, I was a principle barista.

#### [Iflytek][iflytek] | Software Developer | 2007.07 - 2010.05

an office management system for a telecom company,
analysis systems for different police stations.
