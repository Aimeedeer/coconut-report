### # Developer Market Strategy

Business strategy defines directions and focuses.
Positioning the developer community building
in your business map is the key step.

We start with positioning strategy.
I help you understand open source developers globally
and developers in China if it is on your business map.
I then offer proposals on the micro strategy
and break it down into actional solutions.

We will see growing developer members, conversations,
and community activities by regularly review the growth status.

A strategic proposal includes,
- Define your business requirements, goals, and current states.
  Target the right audience
- Developer-oriented branding strategy
- Developer-oriented engaging strategy

The final execution solutions may or may not contain,
- Content marketing strategy and planning
- Advocating strategy and planning
- Maintaining playbook

### # Content Marketing Strategy

Content marketing can not be more important
than other engaging activities for developers.
It reaches a wilder audience efficiently and spread
your vision and voice of building a community with developers together.

We discuss your tech focus and strength,
and the vision of the community.
I help you to start and keep conversations with targeting audiences
by managing the right marketing content.
You will know what type of content is developersâ€™ favorite,
where and how to reach and respond to developers,
and how to make the content actionable and easy to interact with.

In the end, you will build relationships with developers
and receive their contributions in the future.

Developer-oriented content marketing includes:
- Developer targeting
- Developer-oriented materials from your business and community discussions
- Content strategic planning:
  content calendar, writing, and distributing

## Policies

A successful developer community has its own **Code of Conduct**,
and I wrote policies for my consulting service.
For our successful cooperation,
please make sure you have read it before starting conversations.

- Be kind, and be respectful.
  Express opinions, but do not judge differences.
  Believe that both of us want to make good things happen,
  and achieve our common goals.
- Take responsibilities.
  I offer suggestions and proposals, but things wouldn't
  move forward without execution teams' performance.
  Make sure both of us doing our jobs.

Either we formed a collaboration or not,
I hope we have decent conversations.
